      <h1 id="accessibility-what-and-why">Accessibility What And Why</h1>
<p>We would like to explain why accessibility    matters so much and what a screen reader is in a friendly way, simply, and in an understandable fashion.</p>
<p>Computers are very good inventions that has opened a lot of doors to many people including people with disabilities. Before such things, lives could be lead, but definitely access to the world was more difficult and limited. As blind individuals we can not read print nor what is on our computer screens even with magnification. Some people who are low vision or are partially sighted or have visual impairments who are not totally blind could in some ways, but people who are totally blind certainly could not.</p>
<p>The computer has opened up many avenues for work, reading many forms of texts, and finding materials possible. It has opened up many things. With the advent of the screenreader it is possible.</p>
<p>A screenreader does just that read anything on the screen that the computer passes it or text that is passed along to the computer user that is displayed on the screen, the screenreader accesses. It can read many things besides images at the moment, but new technologies is making recognizing this easier. As a user uses their computers and moves their cursor around the screen the screenreader reads it out and provides information, and reads aloud the website, computer systems or apps. When it comes to screenreader on mobile devices, this is when a user’s finger touches or land on an element or an item on the screen. Whatever a user touches this is what the mobile screen reader reads aloud. </p>
<p>Many software companies have now embedded such a thing in to their systems which has made  computers very usable for the blind person. Apple has a in built screen reader called Voiceover. On  iOS devices that apple has made VoiceOver is also available. Google has built talkback for android and chromevox for their Chromebooks. Windows has a screen reader that is a little less developed but with windows 10 and 11 it has really improved drastically. Windows in-built screen reader is called narrator. There are also third party screenreaders for android and windows. In terms of windows well known third party  screen readers are Jaws and NVDA. There are well lesser known screen readers for these platforms and things that other individuals have developed</p>
<p>The screenreader can help computer users read texts, access computers for work, education, leisure, personal finance, etc… and it has made things so much more accessible and reachable to the blind user and other disabled individuals. Today because of accessibility and efforts of such things, users are able to use apps, websites, browse a lot of the internet, find many sources of information, use navigation or travel applications, and even mindlessly scroll through social media if they so wish, just like anyone else who is sighted would. Such accessible technologies has equalized the playing field. And made the world of technology that is usable and accessible to the sited population just as usable and accessible to the blind community.</p>
<p>However there is still barriers there are rules and protocols in terms of doing  and rules to make it accessible. In some cases websites can be accessible if it follow the rules of coding that will best enable a screenreader to do its job. These are called standards and for the online world you could follow WCAG guidelines, but to exceed it is even better. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">Click for  WCAG  guidelines.</a> Apple itself also has strict standards for coding  apps that are accessible. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/accessibility">click for Apple’s accessibility guidelines.</a></p>
<p>When websites  and apps are inaccessible it makes the platform harder to access and use. It may skip over stuff on the website, not be accessible to the screen reader, or a user may be confused what an unlabeled button or other elements will do for them. This will create confusion, and increased frustration in accessing the site. Screenreader users will not want to use the website or frequent it. This is because it is tricky to access or to read  the website, and a screen reader user needs to spend much more  effort just to use the website, and in some cases it is not possible at all. When it comes to work, a worker who has to use it may find the job confusing or even impossible to do. It becomes a chore to do the job and in a way it is discriminatory no matter whether it is intended or unintended. It creates a digital barrier for blind people. It becomes harder to use and the level playing field is once against skewed.</p>
<p>This matters in business and business technologies because if a platform is  accessible this makes it difficult to employ blind people, due to the blind individuals difficulties  in using the software. This barrier  is a bad thing because there is already a mass unemployment rate within the blind community.</p>
<p>Blind individuals despite their lack of vision has the ability to perform all manners of tasks and work including in the telecommunication, technology, and many other various fields. They in fact do just that.. </p>
<p>Technology is great and a great equalizer and helpful tool to all, only if things can be made and assured to be accessible. This is possible by following baked in inclusive and user friendly design and a desire to help and create an inclusive environment for all. This includes helping to ensure that access to screen readers is accessible for the blind. Also accessibility can also mean assuring that screen contrast, font size, and other options are available for the visually impaired user who can still use some vision along with magnification and other tools on their computers and on the websites</p>
